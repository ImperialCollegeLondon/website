								Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for energy production. Germline and somatic mutations can arise in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Heteroplasmy is a measurement of the different types of mtDNA that are present in a cell. Variations in heteroplasmy and the number of copies of mtDNA per cell have been associated with various human diseases and mitochondrial dysfunction. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is used to characterise and quantify all mRNA transcripts that are present in a single-cell. This method could be used to quantify heteroplasmy and study its impacts on which genes are expressed. Here, methods for removing confounding variation resulting from repeating scRNA-seq experiments were analysed using various statistical techniques. In addition, two mathematical models were compared to establish whether the results that they simulate are sufficiently different from each other to be able to identify, from scRNA-seq data, the model that the empirical data follows. Both models simulate how mtDNA copy number changes over time. It was concluded that by comparing mtDNA copy number alone, it is inadequate for identifying one model from another.  </p>

								<p>Germline or somatic mutations can arise in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leading to a wide range of mitochondrial disorders and contributing towards ageing. Studying heteroplasmy and mtDNA copy number can provide insights into the cellular mechanisms in place for regulating and controlling mtDNA populations. This can provide valuable information about how mutations can propagate themselves and become fixed in a population. Here, various corrective methods were analysed using R for removing technical confounders, or batch effects, in datasets obtained from single-cell RNA-seq. Based on the PCA and density plots produced, ComBat and GLM were identified as the most effective methods for removing batch effects. In addition, two mathematical models that differ in their function of mtDNA replication rate were stochastically simulated using the Gillespie algorithm. The mtDNA copy numbers predicted by the models at two closely-spaced time intervals were compared by producing kernel density estimation plots. It was concluded that analysing copy number alone is inadequate for model identification as the distributions were too similar. </p>
