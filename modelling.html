										<h1>Modelling mtDNA copy number</h1></header>
										<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>Having an understanding of the mechanisms that determine cellular levels of mtDNA is important for understanding and treating mitochondrial disease, however it is difficult to measure these mechanisms experimentally without damaging the cells <a href=references.html>(Chinnery & Samuels, 1999)</a>. Mathematical approaches can be powerful alternative routes for investigating the longitudinal changes occurring in mtDNA heteroplasmy over time <a href=references.html>(Chinnery & Samuels, 1999; Johnston & Jones, 2016)</a>.</p>
									<p>Comparing the trajectories predicted by different mathematical models is valuable if the trajectories are sufficiently different. Empirical data can be compared with model predictions and the model underlying the system from which the data has been obtained can be identified. By doing this, insights can be gained into the dynamics of the system and the mechanisms driving changes in mtDNA copy number. By understanding the model underlying a healthy system, it is possible that perturbations, for example caused by cancerous tumours, can be identified. </p>
									<p>Two models of mtDNA replication and degradation, the linear feedback control model <a href=references.html>(Hoitzing et al., 2017)</a> and the relaxed replication model <a href=references.html>(Johnston & Jones, 2016)</a>, were compared in order to identify whether the trajectories of population changes that they predicted were sufficiently different to one another. </p>
									<h2>Methods</h2>
									<h3>The Linear Feedback Control model</h3>
									<p>	The linear feedback control (LFC) model assumes that the mitochondrial population is under homeostatic control and that the replication rate of mtDNA changes with deviations of the effective mtDNA population size away from the desired value. The degradation rate $&mu;$ of mtDNA is constant with feedback control being achieved through the replication rate $&lambda; = &lambda;(w,m)$. The LFC model does not distinguish between different mtDNA types, i.e. mutant or wild type, with respect to their fitness. The LFC model uses various parameters, a summary of which is shown in table 3. See figure 7 for a diagrammatic representation of both models. </p>
									<h3>The Relaxed Replication model</h3>
									<p>The relaxed replication (RR) model assumes a continuous turnover of mtDNA in post-mitotic cells <a href=references.html>(Capps, Samuels & Chinnery, 2003; Chinnery & Samuels, 1999)</a>. mtDNA degradation is modelled as a stochastic Poisson process with rate $1/&tau;$ (Johnston & Jones, 2016). The replication rate of mtDNA is also modelled as a stochastic process of rate $&lambda;(w,m)$ which is a deterministic function of w and m. At each time step $&Delta;t$, the value of $&lambda;(w,m)$ is calculated as $&Delta;t&lambda;(w,m)$ for determining how many mtDNA are added to the population. The genetic properties of the mtDNA that are added to the population are stochastic but the physical properties, such as the total copy number, are deterministic. Similarly to the LFC model, neither mutants nor wild types have a selective advantage in the RR model. The parameters used in the RR model are described in table 3 and figure 7 is a schematic of the model.</p>

					<h3>Model simulation</h3>
					<p>Both models were simulated using the Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (GSSA). The GSSA is a stochastic stimulation approach in which one reaction is executed at a time <a href=references.html>(Gillespie, 1977)</a>.  The GSSA seeks to answer the two following questions in order to simulate the system: when will the next reaction occur; and what kind of reaction will it be? It aims to answer these questions by introducing the reaction probability density function $P(&tau;,&mu;)$ which is defined as: <li>$P(&tau;,&mu;)d&tau; &cong;$ the probability that given the state ($X$<sub>1</sub>,…,$X$<sub>N</sub>) at time $t$, the next reaction in $V$ will occur in the infinitesimal time interval ($t +  &tau;, t + &tau; + d&tau;$), and will be an $R$<sub>&mu;</sub> reaction <a href=references.html>(Gillespie, 1977)</a>.</li></p><p> The probability of each reaction occurring is calculated based on the reaction’s hazard, which depends on the number of reactant molecules in that specific reaction and in the system overall. The time interval until the next reaction is calculated by generating a uniform random number <a href=references.html>(Gillespie, 1977)</a>. This process of stochastically selecting the next reaction and the time interval is repeated until the maximum time ($TMAX$) has elapsed.</p>
					<p>Both models were simulated in this way for $100$ iterations with the initial conditions of $20$ copies of wild type mtDNA and $0$ copies of mutant mtDNA. At $t=100$ ($t1$) the algorithm returned the wild type mtDNA copy number, as well at either $t=100.25, t=100.5, t=101, t=102, t=105$ or $t=110$ ($t2$). The copy numbers from both of these time points are essentially paired data points, enabling the values obtained at $t1$ to be plotted against those obtained at $t2$. Kernel density estimation (KDE) contour plots were generated for each model for each $t2$ value. Finally, the replication rates ($&lambda;$<sub>L</sub> and $&lambda;$<sub>R</sub>) were plotted as function of $w$, i.e. mtDNA copy number, for values around $w$<sub>opt</sub>.<p>
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>Figure 8 presents the KDE plots for both models showing how the wild type mtDNA copy number changes during time intervals of $0.25$, $2$ and $10$ ($t2 = 100.25, 102, 110$). KDE plots are made up of concentric circles of decreasing density from the centre outwards. In this case, higher density values correspond to a higher frequency of iterations returning those copy number values at both time points. Therefore, the data points found on the innermost circle can be considered as the most common, and those found on the outermost circle can be considered as the least common.

						<p>
						<p>The topologies of the KDE plots appear different between the models on a first glance. Firstly, the contours for the RR model are much closer together for all time points than those for the LFC model. Furthermore, the overall size of the plots is much lower for the RR model than the LFC model, i.e. there is less variation in values. The density values for the RR model are generally higher than the corresponding density values for the LFC model. For two out of the three selected time intervals, there are more contours for the RR model than the LFC model. However, except for the differences in the range of copy number values, the plots produced for the two models are not very different. Both produce plots that are similar in shape to each other. For example in figure 8Ai and 8Bi, both shapes are diagonal ovals with similar gradients. </p>
						<p>The KDE plots for both models have similar changes in their shapes as the time interval increases, i.e. $t2$ goes from $0.25$ to $10$. Their diagonal oval changes to becoming a more sprawling circular. Furthermore, the maximum density for both models decreases as the time interval gets larger. </p>
						<p>Figure 9 is an interactive plot showing how the replication rate changes around values of $w$<sub>opt</sub> for both models. $&lambda;$<sub>L</sub> drops off dramatically prior to and after values lower than $w$<sub>opt</sub>. For the RR model, $&lambda;$<sub>R</sub> still decreases up until and after $w$<sub>opt</sub> but not at such a rapid rate. </p>

								<h2>Discussion</h2>
								From a first glance, the two models appear to result in slightly different mtDNA population trajectories. For each time interval, the RR model shows less variation in mtDNA copy number at both $t1$ and $t2$ in comparison to the LFC model. This difference in variation of copy numbers, however, may not be adequate to distinguish between the two models given a dataset of mtDNA copy numbers obtained at two closely-spaced time intervals. Furthermore, the difference in variation could result from parameters used in either model. The $b$ parameter from the LFC model is set to $10$<sup>-4</sup>. Given that this parameter (see table 3) controls how tightly stochastic trajectories are controlled around the steady state, by increasing b the variation observed in copy numbers in the LFC model may decrease, resulting in a plot that more closely resembles that of the RR model.<p>
								</p>Figure 9 shows that the replication rate varies between the two models around values of $w$<sub>opt</sub>. Specifically, it shows that the LFC experiences a more rapid reduction in replication rate, which causes the feedback mechanism that controls the mtDNA population size in this model. By focusing on just one parameter, it is evident that the two models cause different trajectories, suggesting that further analyses should be performed to identify how the models differ. <p>
								</p>Other approaches could be used to attempt to distinguish between the models. Firstly, the smallest time interval investigated here was $0.25$ which corresponds to a quarter of a day or 6 hours. By further reducing this time interval to one that is small enough to only allow a couple of reactions, it is possible that more remarkable differences between the two models may be observable. Secondly, in this study the mtDNA copy number has essentially been tracked at the single-cell level and the values corresponding to multiple cells have been reported. An alternative approach would be to track single organelles to see how frequently the organelles duplicate or degrade. This would be more a more precise representation than studying at the cellular level. Finally, a system which is at the steady state of mtDNA could be taken and disrupted by using mitochondrial zinc finger nucleases (mtZFNs) or mitochondrial talens (mtTALENs; <a href=references.html>Gammage, Moraes & Minczuk, 2017)</a>. Once the steady state has been knocked out, the recovery of the mtDNA population could be examined in order to independently estimate the parameters used in either model, for example $b$. These estimated parameters could then be integrated into the models and the models could be compared again in case the trajectories had changed.
								<p>
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									The LFC and the RR models are mathematically distinct models used for modelling mtDNA population dynamics over time. Being able to distinguish between results obtained from either method is important to identify underlying mechanisms driving changes to mtDNA populations. Here, it has been shown that comparing copy numbers obtained during a short time interval is inadequate for identifying either model from the other. Other methods, such as decreasing the time interval or independently estimating parameters, could be attempted.</p>
