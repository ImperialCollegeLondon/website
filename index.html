									<h1>Introduction</h1></header>
									<h2>Mitochondria</h2>
									<p>Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for energy transduction and metabolism <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015; Taanman, 1999)</a>. Mitochondria are thought to have arisen due to a proteobacterium becoming associated with and endocytosed by a prokaryotic cell leaving a double-membraned organelle <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015)</a>.  Due to multiple passages overtime of genetic material from the endocytosed organelle into the prokaryotic cell nucleus, the genome of the organelle shrank in size. The end result was mitochondria and their autonomously replicating DNA genome of 16.5 kilo-base pairs, as shown in figure 1 <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015; Anderson et al., 1981)</a>.
	Overtime, various differences have arisen between nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). For example, mtDNA is packaged in a circular coding arrangement with multiple independently-proliferating copies present in each cell <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015)</a>. Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes, meaning that healthy functioning of the mitochondria is dependent on both genetic systems <a href=references.html>(Anderson et al., 1981; Stewart & Chinnery, 2015)</a>.</p>

							<h2>Motivation for studying mitochondria</h2>
							Deleterious mutations in mtDNA emerge at high frequencies and have been associated with ageing, cancer, infertility and degenerative diseases <a href=references.html>(Wallace, 1999; Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2000; Gemmell, Metcalf & Allendorf, 2004)</a>. mtDNA, and consequently mitochondrial diseases, are maternally inherited <a href=references.html>(Sato & Sato, 2013)</a>. This enables the accumulation of mutations that are (nearly) neutral in females but deleterious in males as selection is only able to act on mutations that affect females <a href=references.html>(Camus, Clancy & Dowling, 2012)</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Heteroplasmy</h2>
							Heteroplasmy is the term used to describe the mixture of wild type and mutant mtDNA within a given cell. Heteroplasmy levels vary greatly between cells <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015)</a>. Heteroplasmic mutations affect multiple organ systems, with the level of heteroplasmy correlating with the severity of the phenotype and the level of organ vulnerability and involvement <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015; DiMauro et al., 2013)</a>. Variants with low mutational burdens can accumulate to high levels over time resulting in biochemical defects once a threshold has been surpassed, as shown in figure 2 <a href=references.html>(Brierley et al., 2004; Stewart & Chinnery, 2015)</a>.

									<figcaption class="img-comment" style="margin: auto; text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><strong>Figure 2: </strong>A schematic to demonstrate how different levels of heteroplasmy can affect the phenotype of the cell. Once heteroplasmy levels exceed a certain threshold (as can be observed in the grey cell) the phenotype, e.g. the biochemical defect, can be observed. This image has been adapted from <a href=references.html>Stewart and Chinnery (2015)</a>.</font></figcaption>

						</p>
						Various methods can be used to quantify heteroplasmy including DNA sequencing <a href=references.html>(Irwin et al., 2009)</a>, high-performance liquid chromatography <a href=references.html>(Meierhofer et al., 2005)</a> and pyrosequencing <a href=references.html>(Sazonova et al., 2009)</a>.</p>

							<h2>Copy number</h2>
							In order to maintain cellular function and energy requirements, the number of copies of mtDNA present in cells is tightly regulated so that the appropriate amount of ATP can be generated  <a href=references.html>(Stewart & Chinnery, 2015; Dickinson et al., 2013)</a>. mtDNA copy number varies greatly between different cell types. Cells with high-energy requirements, such as neurons or muscle cells, maintain higher copy numbers in comparison to those with low-energy requirements, such as endothelial or spleen cells  <a href=references.html>(Dickinson et al., 2013)</a>. Studying mtDNA copy number in healthy cells will enable deviations from the norm to be more readily identified and can serve as a surrogate marker for the cellâ€™s oxidative phosphorylation capacity  <a href=references.html>(Reznik et al., 2016)</a>. Furthermore, changes in mtDNA copy number have been observed in various cancers. mtDNA copy number depletion has been identified in bladder, kidney and breast cancer and has been often associated with reduced expression of mitochondrial genes and activity  <a href=references.html>(Reznik et al., 2016)</a>.

							<h2>Project aims</h2>
							<center><li>Apply various corrective methods to single-cell RNA-seq data obtained from cells with varying levels of heteroplasmy. Identify and remove batch effects.</li></p>
							<li>Gain an insight into how different mathematical models can be used to simulate fluctuations in mtDNA population levels. Compare two stochastic models - the relaxed replication model and the linear feedback control model - to see how mtDNA copy number varies over time under their simulations.</li></center></p>
